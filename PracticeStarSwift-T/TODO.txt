play with the content mode of the images for my final project

make the variables private where necessary and add the functions to encaplulate



DESIGN INPUT FROM NATE:

A TEACHER can specify the points worth for each of the task item

The more difficult assignment is the more points awarded - the more the medal is worth (motivation)

so, HAVE MEDALS ADD POINTS TO YOUR SCORE (based on the percentage off of the total points earned for that assignment)

Divide medals into three category: assignments where each point worth from
			1 to 5 points
			5 to 7 points
			7 on

Display the points added by the medal on the medal itself.

In the footer by the buttons, also display the total number of points validated earned per that assignment and the bonus points from the medal , if any



ADD  the total percentage score to the awards tab (overall score based on "how many points I have earned even with medals" / "how many points all of my assignments had"


Add the helper character like from Dojo (yozhik) walker through for the on boarding.
